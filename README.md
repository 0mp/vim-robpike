# vim-robpike

This is a minimal Vim color scheme working fine with both white and black
terminal backgrounds.

## Build

```sh
./build > ~/.vim/colors/robpike.vim
```

## Inspiration

> When I was a child, I used to speak like a child, think like a child,
> reason like a child; when I became a man, I did away with childish
> things.

> Syntax highlighting is juvenile. When I was a child, I was taught
> arithmetic using [colored rods]. I grew up and today I
> use monochromatic numerals.
